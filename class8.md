# Operators and Loops

## Comparison Operators:
Evaluating conditions.
*You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be.*
The result will be a Boolean: true or false.

- == (equal to)
- != (not equal to)
- === (Strictly equal to)
- !== (Strict not equal to)
- ’>’ (Greater than)
- ’<’ (Less than)
- ’>=) (Great than or equal to)
- ’<=’ (Less than or equal to)

## Logical Operators:
Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false.
**Logical Operators** allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.


## Loops
Loops check a condition. If it returns **true**, a code block will run.
Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns **true**,
the code block will run again. It repeats itself until the condition returns **false**.

### There are three common types of loops:

#### 1. For
If you need to run code a specific number of times, use a **For** loop.
(It is the most common loop.)
In a for loop, the condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run.

#### 2. While
If you do not know how many times the code should run, you can use a **While** loop.
Here the condition can be something other than a counter, and the code will continue to loop as long as the condition is true.

#### 3. Do While
The do..while loop is similar to the while loop, but has one key difference:
It will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to **false**.


## Loop Counters
A for loop uses a counter as a condition.
This instructs the code to run a specified number of times.

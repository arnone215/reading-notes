# Read 10: JavaScript book, Ch. 10, â€œError Handling & Debugging". Pgs 449-486.  

*JavaScript can be hard to learn and everyone makes mistakes when writing it. This chapter will help you learn how to find errors in your code. It will also teach you how to write scripts that deal with potential errors gracefully.*  
When you are writing Javascript, do not expect to write it perfectly the first time. Programming is much like problem solving: you are given a puzzle and not only to you have to solve it, but you also need to create the instructions that allow the computer to solve it too.  
  
  When writing a long script, nobody gets everything right their first attempt. The error messages that a browser gives look cryptic at first, but they can help you determine what went wrong in your JavaScript and how to fix it. In this chapter you will learn about:  
  - The console and dev tools.  
  Tools built into the browser that help you hunt for errors.  
  - Common problems.  
  Common sources of errors, and how to solve them.  
  - Handling errors.  
  How code can deal with potential errors gracefully.

## HTML and Javascript


### What is HTML?


**HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language**

- It is the structural portion of a website or app.
- You can create CSS, Javascript, etc. internally, inside of your HTML or externally.

#### HTML is made up of several necessary components like the:

- Head
- Body
- Footer

*Without HTML, there would be no content inside of a page*


### What is Javascript?

- JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
- In other words, it is the part of building a website or application that is responsible for the FUNCTIONALITY.

*Not to be confused with Java, which is a completely different language of code*


### Easiest way to describe how HTML and Javascript work together?
- Picture a house. Of course you have wood, metal and other materials.
- HTML would be the structural aspect of it, the house itself.
- Javascript would be like the hinges on your front door! It is creating a way for you to open and close that front door!

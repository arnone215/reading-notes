## How Javascript makes web pages interactive

1. Access content
2. Modify content
3. Program rules (set of steps for browser to follow, like a recipe)
4. React to events
- Button being pushed
- A link is closed
- Curser hovers over an element
- Info is added to a form
- etc.

## Key Concepts of Computer Programing: Pages 13-24

1. What is a script and how do I create them?
2. How do computers fit in with would around them?
3. How do I write a script for a web page?+

** A script is a series of instructions **

## How to write a script

1. Define the goal
2. Design the script
3. Code each step
*FLOW CHART*

## Designing a script
Ex: How to start a car
1. Locate car
2. Use key to unlock car
3. Pull door handle to open door
4. Sit in driver's seat
5. Fasten seatbelt
6. Put key in ignition
7. Turn key forward to start engine

## From steps to code
- Every step for every task shown in flowchart needs to be written in language computer can understand
- You need to learn to "think" like a computer because they have different ways than we approach them (break it down to simplest steps)

### Summary
- A script is a series of instructions cpu can follow to achieve goal
- Each time script runs, it might only use a subset of all instructions
- Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so instructions must let cpu solve task programmatically
- To approach writing a script, break down your goal into series of tasks then work out each step needed to complete that task (flowchart)

Expressions + Operators: 74 - 79
Functions: 88 - 94


## Expressions

An **expression** results in a single value.
There are two types of expressions
1. Expressions that assign a value to a variable
- It needs to be given a value 
Ex: var color = 'beige';
2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value
- You can perform operations on any number of individual values
Ex: var area = 3 * 2;
The value of area is now 6.

## Operators

Expressions rely on things called operators, they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

1. Assignment Operators
*Assign a value to a variable*
color = 'beige';
The value of color is now beige.

2. Arithmetic Operators
*Perform basic math*
area = 3 * 2;
Value of area is 6.

3. String Operators
*Combine two strings*
greeting = 'Hi ' + 'Molly';
The Value of greeting is now Hi Molly.

4. Comparison Operators
Compare two values and return **TRUE** or **FALSE**
buy = 3 > 5;
*The value of buy is false*

5. Logical Operators
Combine expressions and return true or false
buy = (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);

# Forms and JS events  

From the Duckett HTML book:

## Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175)

*Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred to a printed document that contains spaces for you to fill in information.*  
HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to different elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to your site.  
  
  Whether you are adding a simple search box to your website or you need to create more complicated insurance applications, HTML forms give you a set of elements to collect data from your users.  
  Here you will learn:
  - How to create a form on your website.
  - The different tools for collecting data.
  - New HTML5 form controls.
  
  ### Why forms?
  *The best known form on the web is probably the search box that sits right in the middle of Google's homepage.*  
  In addition to enabling users to search, forms also allow users to perform other functions online.  
  You will see forms when registering as a member of a website, when shopping online, and when signing up for newsletters or mailing lists.  
  

## Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms” (pp.330-357)  

*There are several CSS properties that were created to work with specific types of HTML elements, such as lists, tables and forms.*  

In this chapter you will learn how to:  
- Specify the type of bullet point or numbering on lists.
- Add borders and backgrounds to table cells.
- Control the appearance of form controls.  
Together, these properties allow you to take finer control over specific parts of your pages.  
  
  
  
From the Duckett JS book:  

## Chapter 6: “Events” (pp.243-292)

*When you browse the web, your browswer registers different types of events. It's the browser's way of saying, "Hey, this just happened." Your script can then respond to these events.*  
Scripts often respond to these events by updating the content of the web page (via the Document Object Model) which makes the page feel more interactive.  
In this chapter you will learn how:  
- Interactions Create Events.  
Events occur when users click or tap on a link, hover or swipe over an element, type on the keyboard, resize the window, or when the page they requested has loaded.  
- Events trigger code.  
When an event occurs, or fires, it can be used to trigger a particular function. Different code can be triggered when users interact with different parts of the page.  
- Code responds to users.  
In the last chapter, you saw how the DOM can be used to update a page. The events can trigger the kinds of changes the DOM is capable of. This is how a web page reacts to users.

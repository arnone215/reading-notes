# CSS - Color!

Color can really bring life to your pages.

## Foreground Color
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element.
You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

1. RGB Values.
These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make up a certain color.
Ex: rgb(100.100.90)
2. Hex Codes.
These are 6 digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue preceded by a hash tag sign.
Ex: #ee3e80
3. Color Names.
There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers.
Ex: DarkCyan.

## Background Color
Css treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.
By default, most browsers have a white background but browser users can set a background color for their windows.

## Contrast
When picking foreground and background colors it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.
Ex: High, medium and low.

# Opacity
Opacity allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements.
The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0.
Ex: 0.5 would be 50%.

# HSL colors
- Hue
- Saturation
- Lightness
* HSLA = HSL + A (alpha)

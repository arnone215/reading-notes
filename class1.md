### Understanding Growth Mindset
 **A Growth Mindset can be determined when an individual**

*IS FACED WITH?* /  *HOW THEY REACT.*
- Challenges, they embrace them.
- Criticism, they learn from it.
- Success of others, It inspires them!
#### A great example of a Growth Mindset outlook, would be Michael Jordan's 'Flu Game', in which he refused to sit out Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals while he was battling illness. Scoring an unbelievable 38 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists, 3 steals and 1 block, including a 3-pointer with less than a minute left that gave the Bulls a lead they did not relinquish.

### What is Markdown?

Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the internet easier. The philosophy behind Markdown is that plain text documents should be readable without tags mussing everything up, but there should still be ways to add text modifiers like 
-Lists 
- **bold**
- *italics* 
- Etc.

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

When using React, you generally donâ€™t need to call addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.

When you define a component using an ES6 class, a common pattern is for an event handler to be a method on the class.

You have to be careful about the meaning of this in JSX callbacks. In JavaScript, class methods are not bound by default. If you forget to bind this.handleClick and pass it to onClick, this will be undefined when the function is actually called.

This is not React-specific behavior; it is a part of how functions work in JavaScript. Generally, if you refer to a method without () after it, such as onClick={this.handleClick}, you should bind that method.

If calling bind annoys you, there are two ways you can get around this. If you are using the experimental public class fields syntax, you can use class fields to correctly bind callbacks.

Passing Arguments to Event Handlers
Inside a loop, it is common to want to pass an extra parameter to an event handler.

## Command Line

#### What is a Command Line?

A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
Command lines (Line 1) are used as a prompt aka Input.
Lines 2-5 generate output from the command line. Other commands just perform their task and don't display any information unless there was an error.
Line 6 presents us again with a prompt. If no prompt is displayed then the command may still be running.

#### Opening a Terminal

- If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.
- If on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.
- If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty (free) .

#### The Shell, Bash

Part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after executing your command. 
There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash which stands for Bourne again shell.
You may use a command called echo to display a system variable stating your current shell. echo is a command which is used to display messages.
If it prints something, you're good to go!

#### Shortcuts

When you enter commands, they are actually stored in a history. You can traverse this history using the up and down arrow keys. So don't bother re-typing out commands you have previously entered, you can usually just hit the up arrow a few times.

# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Chap 4: Links p.74-93
- Creating links between pages.
- Linking to other sites.
- Email links.

***Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another, enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing the web.***

You will commonly come across the following type of links:

- Links from one website to another.
- Links from one page to another on the same website.
- Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page.
- Links that open in a new browser window.
- Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone.

*Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening tag and the closing tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute*

## Chap 15: Layout p.358-404

**Layout**
- Controlling the position of elements.
- Creating site layouts.
- Designing for different sized screens.
*Refer to pages listed above*

## Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” p.86-99

*** Browsers require very detailed instructions about what we want them to do. Therefor, complex scripts can run to hundreds or even thousands of lines. Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code. This chapter is divided into three sections that inroduce:***
- Functions & methods
- Objects
- Built-in objects

### What is a function?
*Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function rather than repeating the same set of statements.*
- Grouping together the statements that are required to answer a question or perform a task, helps organize your code. 
- Furthermore, the statements in a function are not always executed when a page loads, so functions also offer a way to store the steps needed to acheive a task. The script can then ask the function to perform all of those steps as and when they are required.
- For example, you may have a task that you only want to perform if the user clicks on a specific element in the page. 
- If you are going to ask the function to perform its task later, you need to give your function a name. That name should describe the task it is performing. When you ask it to perform its task, it is known as **calling** the function.
- The steps that the function needs to perform in order to perform its task are packaged up in a code block. You may remember from the last chapter that a code block consists of one or more statements contained within curly braces. Also, you do not write a semicolon after the closing curly brace like you do after a statement.
- Some functions need to be provided with information in order to achieve a given task. For example a function to calculate the area of a box would need to know its width and height. Pieces of information passed to a function are known as **parameters**.
- When you write a function and expect it to provide you with an answer, the response is known as a **return value**.

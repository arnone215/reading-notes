# How Computers Work!

## What makes a computer, a computer?
Computers are everywhere!
In our homes, work places, our car, our pockets etc.
We've began to use computers to make work and even life easier.

## 4 tasks of computers
1. Take input
2. Store information
3. Process that info
4. Present output

## Binary & Data
Computers work on 1's and 0's (Basically like a circuit).
The smallest piece of data is called a Bit
Binary only consists of 1 and 0
Ex: Decimal number 0900, converted to a binary number would be 1010

## Circuits and Logic
Input/Output are information.
Computer needs to intake and modify signals which comes together to make circuits.
A simple circuit takes an electrical signal and flips it.
Complicated circuits take multiple signals and combines them.
Ex: 1+1= AND

## CPU, Memory, Input and Output
All computers do the 4 same tasks (refer to above)
Input- Converts phsyical input to binary information
Memory- Stores information
CPU (Central Processing Unit)- Calculates that information
Output- Converts information to physical output

## Hardware and software
Hardware written in binary
Software written in code languages.

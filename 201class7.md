# Readings : Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Chapter 6: “Tables” (pp.126-145 HTML/CSS BOOK)

There are several types of information that need to be displayed in a grid or table. For example: sport results, stock reports, train timetables.  When representing information in a table, you need to think in terms of a grid made up of rows and columns (a bit like a spreadsheet). In this chapter you will learn how to:  
- Use the four key elements for creating tables.
- Represent complex data using tables.
- Add captions to tables.

### What IS a table?
**A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.**  
*Grids allow us to understand complex data by referencing information on two axes.*  
*Each block in the grid is referred to as a **table cell**. In HTML a table is written out row by row.*

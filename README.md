### About Me
Hello there! My name is Thomas, an aspiring Software Developer looking to bring new ideas to the evolution of tech. I have previously served in the United States Army as an Infantryman Squad Leader with much time spent in combat. Some of my hobbies include traveling, exploring new restaurants, and watching The Office when I feel like avoiding the Seattle rain!

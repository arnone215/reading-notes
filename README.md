### Understanding Growth Mindset
 **A Growth Mindset can be determined when an individual**

*IS FACED WITH?* /  *HOW THEY REACT.*
- Challenges, they embrace them.
- Criticism, they learn from it.
- Success of others, It inspires them!
#### A great example of a Growth Mindset outlook, would be Michael Jordan's 'Flu Game', in which he refused to sit out Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals while he was battling illness. Scoring an unbelievable 38 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists, 3 steals and 1 block, including a 3-pointer with less than a minute left that gave the Bulls a lead they did not relinquish.

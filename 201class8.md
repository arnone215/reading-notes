# Chap 15: Layout p.358-404

## Layout

*In this chapter we are going to look at how to control where each element sits on a page and how to create attractive page layouts*  
This involves learning about how designing for a screen can be different from designing for other mediums **such as print**. In this chapter we will:  
- Explore different ways to position elements using normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning, and floats.
- Discover how various devices have different screen sizes and resolutions, and how this affects the design process.
- Learn the difference between fixed width and liquid layouts, and also how they are created.
- Find out how designers use grids to make their page designs look more professional.

### Building blocks

*CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a **block-level** box or an **inline** box.*  
Block level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height as well). To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.

### Containing elements

*If one block level element sits inside another block level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.*  
It is common to group a number of elements together inside a div or other block level element. For example, you may group together all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as a logo and the main navigation). The div element that contains this group of elements is then referred to as the containing element.
